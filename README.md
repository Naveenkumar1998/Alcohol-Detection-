# Alcohol-Detection-
IGNITION CONTROL OF MOTORCYCLE BY DETECTING ALCOHOL AND HELMET

ABSTRACT

This system is aimed at making vehicle driving safer
than before.We have derived the driver’s condition in
real time environment and we propose the detection
of alcohol using alcohol detector such that when the
level of alcohol crosses a permissible limit.

Here we propose a solution to this problem by using a
fingerprint authenticated vehicle starter system. The
system provides a secure and hassle free way to
start/stop vehicle engine.This will detect alcohol blood
pressure content.

The government has made rules that rider should
compulsory wear the helmet and not consume alcohol
and drive. Still the riders do not obey the rules. These
accidents are caused due to negligence of the rider.
Not wearing the helmet causes the rider with head
injuries which may lead to death of the rider.

so,face detection algorithms are used to detect if the rider is wearing helmet or 
not by fixing camera in front of the person in the vehicle so that 
it will capture the image of the person's face whether the helmet is 
present.In order to overcome this an intelligent system, smart helmet is
proposed, it detects the helmet and also the alcohol
present in rider’s breath.

we can resolve these problems by implementing smart technologies 
such as IOT and Machine learning to detect alcohol presence of a vehicle rider.
These technology makes them more secure and leads to avoid accidents.
